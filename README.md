# project 5 api request fo 12 random user of employees with US Nationality


In the style.css file, on line 22-25 and line 100-101, I added code to transition from one color to another. 
```css
@keyframes card-colors {
    from {background-color: rgb(146, 221, 221);}
    to {background-color: rgb(238, 237, 153);}
  }
```
In app.js file in the displayHTML function, I added background color to the cards, on line 53.

In the app.js on line 2, I changed body background.
